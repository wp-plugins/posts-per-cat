== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I would like to get a list of posts but just from one category =

Enter category ID into `Include category` field, and leave unchecked `Only top level categories` checkbox.

= I set in template macro to display excerpt, but no excerpt displayed =

Enable option `Use post content as excerpt` in widget, or provide shortcode parameter `content=1`, because you did not have manually set excerpts for posts, so you must ask PPC to generate excerpt from post content.
